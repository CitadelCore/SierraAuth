# SierraAuth
Small program that performs FCC authentication on Sierra Wireless EM-series modems.
Compile in VS2017, then import Run_GobiAuth.xml in Task Scheduler (by default runs 30 seconds after logon or wake from sleep to give the modem time to boot.)

You need to put GobiApi.dll in the same folder as the executable, you can get this from the latest Sierra Wireless drivers or Skylight.
